# Volunteering

Welcome to my page dedicated to my active volunteer work! I am passionate about giving back to the community and making the world a better place. Volunteering has always held a special place in my heart, as it allows me to contribute my time, skills, and efforts to various organizations and causes that are close to my heart. Through my volunteer experiences, I have witnessed the positive impact that collective action can have on individuals, communities, and society as a whole. Join me on this journey as I share my involvement with some incredible organizations and the meaningful work we do together.

## [Still I Run](https://www.stillirun.org/)

One of the organizations close to my heart is Still I Run. Still I Run is a community of runners and mental health warriors who are dedicated to taking control of our physical and mental well-being while also challenging the stigma surrounding mental illness. They believe that running and physical activity can play a vital role in supporting mental health and promoting overall well-being.

Their mission is to create a safe and inclusive space where individuals can find support, encouragement, and inspiration to pursue an active lifestyle, all while raising awareness about mental health. Through their events, programs, and online community, Still I Run aims to empower individuals living with mental illness to embrace their strength and resilience.

**My Role**
As a volunteer with Still I Run, I have the opportunity to contribute to their mission and make a difference in the lives of individuals struggling with mental health challenges. I actively participate in various events, where I engage with people, share information about the organization, and promote their cause. Selling merchandise allows me to not only raise funds for the organization but also spark conversations about mental health and challenge the societal stigma associated with it.

Additionally, I assist with event set-up and tear-down, ensuring that everything runs smoothly and creates a welcoming atmosphere for participants. By volunteering my time and effort, I feel a sense of fulfillment knowing that I am helping to create a supportive community where individuals can find solace, inspiration, and strength through running and mental health advocacy.

Still I Run embodies the belief that physical and mental well-being are intertwined, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to their impactful work. Together, we strive to break down barriers and promote a culture of understanding and acceptance for those living with mental illness, one step at a time.


## [Michele's Rescue](https://michelesrescue.com/)

Michele's Rescue is a remarkable 501(c)(3) non-profit animal rescue organization based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. Since its establishment in 1997, Michele's Rescue has been dedicated to saving and rehoming animals in need. As a no-kill rescue, they provide a lifeline for animals from shelters across the country, offering them a second chance at finding a loving forever home.

The organization's primary goal is to rescue, rehabilitate, and adopt out animals, ensuring they receive the care, love, and attention they deserve. Michele's Rescue operates on the belief that every animal's life is valuable and that they deserve a chance to experience a safe and happy life.

**My Role**
Within Michele's Rescue, I actively contribute as a foster caregiver for cats. Fostering involves providing a nurturing environment for the animals, tending to their medical needs, ensuring their physical well-being, and offering them the love and care they need to thrive. It is a fulfilling experience to witness their transformation and see them find their forever homes.

In addition to fostering, I also take an active role in leading and volunteering at fundraisers and adoption events. These activities play a crucial role in raising funds for the organization, spreading awareness about their mission, and facilitating successful adoptions. By engaging with the community, I have the opportunity to connect potential adopters with the animals and advocate for responsible pet ownership.

Furthermore, I took the initiative to lead a project aimed at improving Michele's Rescue's internal communication. Effective communication is vital for the smooth functioning of any organization, and by enhancing communication channels, we have been able to streamline operations, strengthen teamwork, and ultimately better serve the animals in our care.

Michele's Rescue holds a special place in my heart as I witness firsthand the impact of their tireless efforts in giving animals a second chance at a loving and fulfilling life. By volunteering my time and skills, I am honored to contribute to their compassionate mission and make a positive difference in the lives of these deserving animals.
