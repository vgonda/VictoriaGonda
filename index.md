I love the work I do as an Android Developer. I enjoy learning about new things, and applying them to my work.

You can often find me at conferences exchanging information with others as a [speaker](talks.md) üé§. Come say hello if you spot me at one!

In addition to speaking at conferences, I also write for [Ray Wenderlich](https://www.raywenderlich.com/u/vgonda) ‚úèÔ∏è in my spare time. I'm a part of their Resident Author team, helping to educate people in Android and Kotlin. As part of my work there, I author's the book _[Android Accessibility by Tutorials](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/android-accessibility-by-tutorials)_ and co-authored _[Android Test-Driven Development by Tutorials](https://www.raywenderlich.com/books/android-test-driven-development-by-tutorials)_.

While studying at [Hope College](https://hope.edu/), I also started getting involved in dance technology and dance production üé≠. I had a couple projects that worked together with a dancer and an Xbox Kinect, and did a significant amount of lighting design. Ask me about them, I love talking about it!

When I‚Äôm not out doing these things, you can find me in my home base in Michigan with my husband, Tyler. In my spare time, I enjoy playing board games with friends, or curled up at home with a good book, my cat, [Peter Pan](https://www.instagram.com/p/BgoGqmRlGSk/) üòª, and hedgehog, [Khoshekh](https://www.instagram.com/p/Bge6vC0h1Cx/) ü¶î.
