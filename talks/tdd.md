# Test-Driven Development on Android

> Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development process where you write failing tests before writing the code to make it pass. This can be a common practice in some technology circles, but we’ve seen slow adoption on Android. Because it’s not embedded in the Android culture, it can be hard to learn how to get started with TDD. In this talk, we’ll go over the basics of TDD, how you can apply it at varying levels in an Android architecture, and what steps to take if you’re working with legacy code. You should walk away from this talk with the tools you need to get started exploring practicing TDD on your own.
