# Kotlinify your MVI

> MVI is a reactive architecture that simplifies the flow of user actions and data. Because it allows us to create clearly decoupled architectural responsibilities, easily manage application state, and write more concise tests, we decided to use MVI in our latest project.
>In this talk we will go over our experience using Kotlin with MVI, and how it compares to other architectures such as MVP and MVVM. We’ll look at how we can use some Kotlin features, such as sealed classes, to accomplish the fundamentals of MVI. You’ll walk away from this talk understanding some benefits of using Kotlin and MVI together and enough practical information to be able to implement the architecture into your own projects.
