# Increase Your Product Quality Through Accessibility

> Making your app accessible for everyone is more than a “nice thing to do” It also increases the quality of your app. Products that keep accessibility in mind are more flexible and easier to use. It’s up to us to direct this step. In this talk, you’ll learn about some of the things you can do to make your app more accessible, and how it makes your product stronger. You’ll walk away with the tools you need to detect accessibility issues, increase the usability of your app, and prevent regressions.
