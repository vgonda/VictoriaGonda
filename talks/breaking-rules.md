# Breaking the Rules

> Last year we got some great style guides from Google and JetBrains for how to write our Kotlin code. Have you ever wondered why some of these rules are in place? Are you curious about the ways in which some features can be abused? In this talk you’ll learn some best practices through hypothetical stories behind how these guidelines came to be. You’ll walk away knowing what things to watch out for in your code and knowledge of some Kotlin programming best practices.
