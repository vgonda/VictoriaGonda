# Customize Your App with MLKit

> The best app is one that's customized for your user, and machine learning is one of the best ways to accomplish this. Machine learning can seem like a daunting topic, but Google's MLKit makes it easy. In this talk, we'll go over how you can make use of this tool in your own mobile applications, with special attention to the new Smart Reply and Language Detection. We'll also cover how you can easily create your very own custom models with Auto ML Vision Edge. You'll leave with an understanding of the tools needed to use machine learning in your apps.
