# Hating Your Neighbor

Growing up in a Christian family I learned that the number two most important rule is to love your neighbor. And given that I've eliminated the first rule by no longer being religious, following this rule of loving your neighbor is one of the number one values I live by.

This core value instilled in me by my family is why I get upset when people choose not to get vaccinated. It's why I feel uncomfortable around these people. You have to have an incredible disregard for your neighbor to not take this small step to keep them safe.

Let's assume you think if you get COVID-19 that you won't have bad symptoms. Fine, believe what you want even though there's no way to predict this. But we do know it's deadly for many.

## If you choose not to get the vaccine, what does this communicate to your neighbor?

**You’re telling them you don’t care if their business fails.** In many establishments it takes one person getting sick to cripple a small business. The pandemic has already been incredibly impactful to small businesses. You’re telling them you don’t care about their livelihood.

**You’re telling them you don’t care if we get more dangerous variants.** Because by not getting the vaccine, you’re one more person the virus can mutate in. Anyone who catches it from you will again be another body. It will get more contagious or more deadly and you could have been a force for preventing that.

**You’re telling them you don’t care about their children.** Parents are in and out of the hospital with their children who have cancer and other diseases that compromise their immune systems. Because of you, they can’t socialize with other kids. Because of you, they’re at greater risk of a small exposure that will cause your neighbors to be childless.

**You’re telling them you don't care about their life.** Because if you get it, you will pass it onto someone, and that person could very well die. You’re telling them you're not willing to do a small thing that will keep them alive.

I chose to surround myself with people who love their neighbors. I don’t want to be around someone who has no concern for if those around them live or die.
